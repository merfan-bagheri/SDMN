## Question 1
Use Linux network namespaces and create the topology in the following figure:

![Image](Images/pic_1.png)

*Figure 1: Network namespace topology with a router*

Each of the nodes and the router are in a different network namespace (not the root namespace). The bridges are in the root network namespace. You should provide a bash script that creates the topology.

When implementing your solution consider these:

- Every node must be able to ping every other node and the router.
- The 172.0.0.0/24 subnet can reach 10.10.1.0/24 only via the router and vice versa. So the router is the default gateway for all of the nodes.

You should provide another script that takes two node names as parameters and starts pinging the second node from the first one (the nodes are shown in green in figure 1). Suppose we run this command:```
./your-script.sh node1 router```

After running it node1 should start pinging the router and the output must be printed in the command line.

## Question 2
Now delete the router and its links to the bridges (Look at figure 2). How can we route packets from one subnet to another? Explain your solution (Including the rules in the root namespace. No implementation is required.).

## Question 3
What if the namespaces are on different servers (virtual machine or physical server) that can see each other in layer 2 (Look at figure 3)? Explain your solution (Including the rules on the servers. No implementation is required.)

# Problem Explanation
## Network Topology and Ping Explanation(Answer 1)

To create the network topology and run the ping tests, follow these steps:

1. Run the `create_topology.sh` script to create the network namespaces, virtual Ethernet pairs, and set up the network interfaces:

   ```bash
   ./create_topology.sh
   ```

   This script performs the following tasks:

   - Creates five network namespaces: `ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`, `ns4`, and `router`.
   - Creates virtual Ethernet pairs and assigns them to the respective namespaces.
   - Brings up the network interfaces and assigns IP addresses to them.
   - Creates two bridges, `br1` and `br2`, and associates the virtual Ethernet pairs with the bridges.
   - Enables IP forwarding on the `router` namespace.
   - Runs some connectivity tests using `ping` commands.

2. Once the topology is set up, you can run the `ping.sh` script to test the connectivity between the nodes and the router:

   ```bash
   ./ping.sh <source_node> <destination_node> <number_of_pings>
   ```

   Here, `<source_node>` can be `node1`, `node2`, `node3`, `node4`, or `router`, and `<destination_node>` can be `node1`, `node2`, `node3`, `node4`, or `router`. `<number_of_pings>` specifies the number of ping packets to send.

   The `ping.sh` script determines the appropriate namespace and destination IP address based on the provided arguments, and then executes the `ping` command within the specified namespace.

The `delete_topology.sh` script can be used to clean up the created network namespaces and virtual Ethernet pairs:

```bash
./delete_topology.sh
```

This script deletes all the network namespaces and virtual Ethernet pairs created by the `create_topology.sh` script.

Explanation of the Topology and Ping:

The `create_topology.sh` script sets up a simple network topology with four nodes (`ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`, and `ns4`) and a router (`router`). The nodes are connected to the router through virtual Ethernet pairs and bridges.

The `ping.sh` script allows you to test the connectivity between the nodes and the router. When you run the script, it determines the appropriate namespace and destination IP address based on the provided arguments, and then executes the `ping` command within the specified namespace.

For example, if you run `./ping.sh node1 node3 3`, the script will execute the following command:

```
ip netns exec ns1 ping -c3 10.10.0.2
```

This will ping the IP address `10.10.0.2` (which is the address of `node3`) from the `ns1` namespace (which is the namespace of `node1`).

The script also handles the case where the source or destination is the `router` namespace. In this case, it will use the appropriate IP address for the router's interfaces.

## Routing Packets between Subnets(Answer 2)

To route packets between the different subnets, you will need to add two interfaces, one for each bridge (`br1` and `br2`), and use IP forwarding to enable communication between the subnets.

Here's your solution explained in more detail, with some grammar corrections:

## Solution

1. Add two interfaces, one for each bridge:
   - **Interface 1**: Connect one side to `br1` and the other side to the kernel (root namespace).
   - **Interface 2**: Connect one side to `br2` and the other side to the kernel (root namespace).

2. Enable IP forwarding in the root namespace:
   - This allows the kernel to forward packets between the different subnets.
   - You can enable IP forwarding by setting the following sysctl parameter:
     ```
     sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
     ```

3. Configure the necessary routing rules in the root namespace:
   - Add routes to the subnets connected to `br1` and `br2` using the appropriate interfaces.
   - For example, if the subnet connected to `br1` is `172.0.0.0/24` and the subnet connected to `br2` is `10.10.0.0/24`, you would add the following routes:
     ```
     ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 dev interface1
     ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 dev interface2
     ```

With this setup, the kernel will be able to forward packets between the different subnets using the two interfaces connected to the bridges. Packets from one subnet will be routed through the appropriate interface to the other subnet, enabling communication between the subnets.

This solution avoids the need for a dedicated router and allows you to manage the routing directly in the kernel, using IP forwarding and routing rules.
## Routing Between Two Subnets in Two Servers Using a Layer 2 Switch (Answer 3)

To connect two different subnets on two different servers using a Layer 2 switch, you can follow these steps:

Firstly, utilize the IP forwarding feature in the Linux kernel of the Virtual Machines (VMs). For instance, in VM1 where ‘br1’ is located, define an interface and connect it to the physical interface that is linked to the physical switch.

On the other hand, in the second server and in VM2, define two interfaces. Connect one end of the interface to the physical interface of VM2 and assign the default gateway IP of the first subnet (for example, 172.0.0.1/24) to the other end of this interface.

Next, connect another interface to ‘br2’ and assign the default gateway IP of the second subnet (for example, 10.10.0.1/24) to the other end of this interface, and leave it in the kernel.

Now, if you activate IP forwarding in the kernel of the second VM, the routing will be done correctly. This is because the kernel has been used as a router and the switch has been used to connect the first gateway with VM1 and VM1 with the first gateway.

If there were multiple subnets or multiple VMs and servers, the kernel could also be used as a router for the VMs in one of the VMs in the same way
